# Tensorflow-Problem using Keras

## Introduction
This is my 4th year Problem sheet for the Iris data set using Keras as part of Tensorflow.

## Assignment Guide:

### Problem set: Tensorflow

These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository. Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.

### 1. Use Tensorflow to create model

Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flower’s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### 2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### 3. Train the model

Use the testing set to train your model.

### 4. Test the model

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.

## What is the Iris Data Set?

The Iris data set or Fishers Iris data set is a multivariate data set created by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

## What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is an open source software developed by Google Brain Team in 2015 which was created and is still used today for numerical computing using data flow graphs.

## What is Keras? 

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
Its purpose of development was to increase the speed at which you can experiment with data.
