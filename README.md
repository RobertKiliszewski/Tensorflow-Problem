# Tensorflow-Problem using Keras

## What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is an open source software developed by Google Brain Team in 2015.
Tensorflow is for for numerical computation using data flow graphs

## What is Keras? 

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
Its purpose of development was to increase the speed at which you can experiment with data.
